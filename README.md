# (Late) Advent of Code 2019

**[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. I chose to solve it using [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), one of the most awesome languages I know.

Thanks [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) for taking care of th bootstrap process.
